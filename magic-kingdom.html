        <h1>Magic Kingdom</h1>
        <p>Magic Kingdom is a theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, 
    Florida, near Orlando, Florida. Owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company 
    through its Parks, Experiences and Products division, the park opened on 
    October 1, 1971, as the first of four theme parks at the resort.</p>

        <h2>Themes</h2>
        <p>Explore the 6 Enchanted Lands of Magic Kingdom Park</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Main Street, U.S.A.</li>
            <li>Adventureland</li>
            <li>Frontierland</li>
            <li>Liberty Square</li>
            <li>Fantasyland</li>
            <li>Tomorrowland</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Symbolically, Main Street, U.S.A. represents the park's "opening credits," 
         where guests pass under the train station (the opening curtain), then view 
        the names of key personnel along the windows of the buildings' upper floors.</P>
       
        <p>Adventureland represents the mystery of exploring foreign lands. It is themed 
        to resemble the remote jungles in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, South America 
        and the South Pacific, with an extension resembling a Caribbean town square.</p>
        
        <p>In Frontierland guests can relive the American Old West, from the romanticized 
        cowboys and Native Americans, to exploring the mysteries of the Rivers of America.</p>
       
        <P>Liberty Square is inspired by a colonial American town set during the American 
        Revolutionary War. The Liberty Belle Riverboat travels down the park's Rivers of America.</P>
        
        <P>Fantasyland is themed in a medieval-faire/carnival style, in the words of Walt Disney:
        "Fantasyland is dedicated to the young at heart and to those who believe that when you wish 
        upon a star, your dreams come true."</P>
        <P>Tomorrowland is set in an intergalactic city, a concept of the future as seen from around 
        the 1950s: rockets, UFOs and robots, etc.</P>
